# Introduction 

Reaction forces play crucial role in steel structures, therefore any mechanical or civil engineer should be able to solve for them. However, in basic trusses or beams solving for reaction forces might take too much time! That is why I decided to create a calculator that will save my time and will also serve as my pet project. Of course, there are plenty of ready solutions for my problem, but I mostly consider Reaction Forces Calculator as a playground and a place to demonstrate my skills.

## Future plans
The first step for that project is a CLI program that should work flawless and deal with unwanted input. 
After the first part I plan to add GUI using Qt software, and finally, the project will appear as an iOS app developed with UIKit.

## Outcomes
By completing all steps of my project I hope to grow as a developer and have a fascinating app in the portfolio.
