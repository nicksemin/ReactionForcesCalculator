# Introduction 

Reaction forces play crucial role in steel structures, any mechanical and civil engineer should be able to solve for them. However, in basic trusses or beams solvinf for reaction forces might take to much time! That is why I decided to create a calcu;ator that will save my time and will also serve as my pet project. Of course, there are plenty of ready solutions for my problem, but I mostly consider Reaction Forces Calculator as my playground and a place to demonstrate my skills.

## Future plans
The first step for that project is a CLI program that should work flawless and deal with unwanted input. 
After the first part I plan to add GUI using QT library, and finally, the project will appear as an iOS app developed with UIKit.

## Outcomes
By completing all steps of my project I hope to develop as a developer and have a fascinating app in the portfolio.
